## TODO LIST WEBSITE - In no particular order

* Think about some kind of user profile (twitter, irc nicks, etc)
* Visualize all kinds of information with envision[http://github.com/michael/envision] technology

## TODO LIST IRC BOT - In no particular order

* Implement our own IRC channel logging instead of relying on irclogger[http://irclogger.com]
* Allow to respond to questions asked from other communication channels (website, twitter, etc)
* Think about additional useful commands

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
   bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
