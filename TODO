* Answer questions
  - Tag a post as answer, establish a link between question and answer, present them on site

* RSS Feeds for everything or certain (combinations of) tags

* Remember the time of posts and provide a backlink to irclogger.com
  - This allows people to understand the context (and following discussion) of a post

    until 'stop listening' was issued.
