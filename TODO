* Allow to post questions and answers on the website, and forward that to the IRC channel

* RSS Feeds for everything or certain (combinations of) tags

* Remember the time of posts and provide a backlink to irclogger.com
  - This allows people to understand the context (and following discussion) of a post

* Provide 'start listening' and 'stop listening' commands
  - After 'start listening' this will initially create a post and subsequently append to it
    until 'stop listening' was issued.
